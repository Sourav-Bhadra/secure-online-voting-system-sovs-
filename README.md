Brief Description
An online voting system is an online voting technique. In this system, people who are registered in the system can cast his/her vote online without going to any physical polling station. There are many voting procedures that are being used for voting purposes, such as ballot paper, EVM machines but all these procedures require more time and more manpower. People also have to wait in long queues which takes a lot of time in the process.

To eliminate all these drawbacks, we provide an online system that provides features such as accuracy, convenience, and privacy. Our website will not only save time but also make a hassle-free user experience. Our online voting system provides a platform with proper instructions where users can register themselves and cast vote remotely. During the entire process, multiple verification processes are carried out which makes this entire system secure. This project gives freedom to the voter to use his/her voting rights from anywhere.

The main aim of this project is to cast votes with proper anti-corruption techniques and to minimize errors and be hassle-free.

Improving the existing/current voting process or approach.
